This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a classic technique for shifting letters in a message for basic encryption and decryption. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform these operations.



The Caesar Cipher is a simple yet historical encryption method that shifts each letter in a message by a certain number of positions (the shift value) along the alphabet. For instance, with a shift value of 3, "hello" becomes "khoor." While a valuable learning tool for cryptography concepts, Caesar Cipher is not secure for real-world use due to its ease of decryption.
